It provides a list of problems or features that users can explore and interact with.
______________________________________________
Description :

The Home page component consists of the following elements:

## Problem List

This section displays a list of buttons, each representing a specific problem or feature available in the application.
Current Page Display: This section renders the selected problem or feature based on user interaction.
 ## Features 
Allows users to navigate between different problems or features by clicking on corresponding buttons.
Dynamically renders the selected problem or feature component without requiring a full page refresh.
No external libraries are used; all components are custom-built.

# 2. Element Transfer Component

The Element Transfer component is a React component that allows users to transfer elements between two buckets. It provides functionalities to add, remove, add all, or remove all elements from the buckets.

## Description

The Element Transfer component consists of the following elements:

-- **Bucket 1**: Displays a list of elements in the first bucket.
-- **Bucket 2**: Displays a list of elements in the second bucket.
-- **Buttons**: Provides options to perform actions such as adding, removing, adding all, or removing all elements.

## Features

- Allows users to select elements from either bucket.
- Supports adding selected elements from one bucket to another.
- Provides options to add all elements from one bucket to another or remove all elements from a specific bucket.
- Utilizes React's useState hook for managing component state.

## 3.Nested List Component

The Nested List component is a React component that displays a hierarchical list of items. Each item can be expanded to reveal its children, creating a nested structure. This component allows users to toggle the expansion state of each item, revealing or hiding its children.

# Description

The Nested List component features the following:

- **Item Expansion**: Users can click on an item to expand or collapse its children.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Supports multiple levels of nesting, allowing for complex hierarchies.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Utilizes React's state management to dynamically render items and their children based on the expansion state.

# Component Logic

The logic of the Nested List component includes the following key points:

-- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of the nested list, including item expansion.
-- **Handling Click Events**: Defines a `handleClick` function to toggle the expansion state of items and their children based on user clicks.
-- **Rendering Nested Structure**: Implements a recursive `renderNestedList` function to render the hierarchical structure of the nested list. This function handles rendering items and their children recursively.
-- **Data Structure**: Represents the nested list data as an array of objects, where each object contains information about an item, including its children.
-- **Conditional Rendering**: Renders different elements based on the expansion state of items, showing or hiding their children dynamically.

## 4. Infinite Scroll Component

The Infinite Scroll component is a React component that implements infinite scrolling behavior, allowing users to load more content as they scroll down the page. This component fetches additional data when the user reaches near the bottom of the page.

# Description

The Infinite Scroll component features the following:

- **Infinite Scrolling**: Dynamically loads more data as the user scrolls down the page, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading indicator while fetching additional data.
- **Data Generation**: Generates new instances of data to simulate loading more content.

# Component Logic

The logic of the Infinite Scroll component includes the following key points:

- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of loading and data.
-  **Data Generation**: Implements a function to generate new instances of data when more content needs to be loaded.
- **Loading More Data**: Defines a function `loadMoreData` to simulate loading more data, appending it to the existing data state.
-- **Scroll Event Listener**: Attaches a scroll event listener to the window to detect when the user has scrolled near the bottom of the page.
-- **Handling Scroll Event**: Implements a function `handleScroll` to trigger the loading of more data when the user has scrolled near the bottom of the page.
  
 ## 5. Game Component

The Game component is a React component that implements a simple word recognition game. Players need to click on the box containing a specific keyword to earn points within a limited time frame.

## Description

The Game component features the following:

- **Gameplay**: Players have to click on the box containing the specified keyword ("HIT") within the allotted time.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points by clicking on the correct box and lose points for clicking on the wrong box.
- **Timer**: A countdown timer indicates the remaining time for the game.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the time runs out, and the final score is displayed.

## Component Logic

The logic of the Game component includes the following key points:

-- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage state variables such as the current keyword index, score, time left, and game over status.
-- **Timer Functionality**: Implements a countdown timer using `setTimeout` and updates the time left state every second.
-- **Handling Clicks**: Defines a function `handleClick` to handle user clicks on the boxes, updating the score based on correctness.
-- **Game Over Condition**: Checks if the game is over when the time left reaches zero and displays the final score.
